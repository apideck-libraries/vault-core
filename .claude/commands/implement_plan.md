# Implement Plan

You are tasked with implementing an approved technical plan from `thoughts/shared/plans/`. These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.

## Getting Started

When given a plan path:

- Read the progress JSON at `thoughts/shared/progress/{plan-name}-status.json` for current phase
- Read the plan completely to understand what needs to be done
- Read the original ticket if referenced
- **Use specialized agents to analyze the codebase** (see Context Management below)
- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together based on agent findings
- Create a todo list to track your progress
- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done

If no plan path provided, ask for one.

## Context Management

To keep the main conversation context lean and focused on implementation decisions:

- **Use codebase-analyzer agent** to read and summarize the specific files mentioned in the plan

  - Request focused summaries of relevant sections, not full file dumps
  - Example: "Analyze `src/utils/useConnections.tsx` and summarize the data fetching and state management patterns"

- **Use codebase-pattern-finder agent** to search for similar patterns in the codebase

  - Even if you don't expect to find patterns, verify assumptions
  - Example: "Search for existing form validation patterns across components"
  - **CRITICAL**: Use this to find reference implementations for the SAME component type you're building
    - Building a component? Find similar components in `src/components/`
    - Adding a hook? Look at other hooks in `src/utils/`
    - Creating a utility? Find utilities with similar functionality

- **Use thoughts-locator agent** if you need related research/decisions not already referenced in the plan

- **Only read files directly** in the main context when you're about to edit them

  - This keeps full file contents out of context until needed
  - Agent summaries are sufficient for understanding current state

- **Launch agents in parallel** when possible to speed up analysis

## Implementation Philosophy

Plans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:

- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find
- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next
- **Match existing code patterns** - use pattern-finder agent to find reference implementations
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update the progress JSON as you complete phases

**Plans provide WHAT and WHY, you provide HOW**:

- The plan tells you WHAT to build and WHY decisions matter (constraints, edge cases)
- You determine HOW by finding and following existing patterns in the codebase
- Use utilities that already exist (don't reinvent helpers)
- Match the style of similar components in the same directory

When things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.

If you encounter a mismatch:

- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed
- Present the issue clearly:

  ```
  Issue in Phase [N]:
  Expected: [what the plan says]
  Found: [actual situation]
  Why this matters: [explanation]

  How should I proceed?
  ```

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

**You MUST follow TDD for all code changes:**

1. **For new files**: Create minimal structure first (empty functions/classes with correct signatures) to prevent import errors in tests
2. **For each feature/change**:
   - Write a failing test that validates the desired behavior
   - Run `tsdx test --no-watch <test-file>` to confirm it fails for the right reason
   - Write ONLY enough code to make the test pass
   - Run `tsdx test --no-watch <test-file>` to confirm it passes
   - Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
3. **Component tests**: Use @testing-library/react with the existing mock patterns in `test/mock.ts`

## Verification Approach

After implementing a phase:

- Run the success criteria checks:
  - Tests: `tsdx test --no-watch` (runs all tests) or `tsdx test --no-watch <pattern>` (specific tests)
  - Linting: `tsdx lint`
  - Build: `tsdx build` (verifies types and compilation)
- Fix any issues before proceeding
- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos
- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit

Don't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.

## If You Get Stuck

When something isn't working as expected:

- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written
- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance

Use sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.

## When to Stop and Ask

You should work autonomously as much as possible, but stop and ask when:

- Plan references files/APIs that don't exist and you can't find suitable alternatives
- Plan approach directly conflicts with existing code patterns you discovered
- Tests fail in unexpected ways unrelated to your changes
- You need business logic decisions (e.g., what should happen in edge case X?)
- Implementation requires breaking changes not mentioned in the plan
- You've debugged thoroughly but can't identify root cause of a failure

When blocked, present: what you tried, what happened, what you've learned, and what options you see. Don't stop for things you can research, debug, or reasonably infer from the codebase.

## Session Startup Protocol

Before starting any phase (including first phase), execute this protocol:

1. **Verify working directory**: Run `pwd` to confirm location
2. **Read progress JSON**: Check `thoughts/shared/progress/{plan-name}-status.json`
   - Identify `current_phase` value
   - Confirm phases array matches plan structure
   - If no JSON exists (legacy plan), determine status from git history
3. **Verify previous work** (if not Phase 1):
   - Run `git log -1 --oneline` to see last commit
   - Confirm previous phase was committed (commit message should reference phase)
4. **Read plan phase**: Go to the phase matching `current_phase` in JSON
5. **Create todos from plan**: Use TodoWrite to track:
   - Session Startup Protocol steps
   - Implementation tasks from "Changes Required"
   - Session Completion steps
6. **Baseline check**: Run `tsdx test --no-watch` on affected test files (if any exist) to verify known-good state

## Resuming Work

When continuing an in-progress plan:

1. **Read progress JSON first**: `thoughts/shared/progress/{plan-name}-status.json`
   - `current_phase` tells you exactly where to resume
   - Status values: "complete", "in_progress", "pending"

2. **Execute Session Startup Protocol** for current phase

3. **Continue implementation** from current phase

**Fallback for legacy plans**: If no progress JSON exists, determine status by reading the plan and checking git history for phase commits.

Remember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.

## Phase Completion Protocol

After completing each phase:

1. **Commit phase work**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Phase N: [brief description]"
   ```

2. **Update progress JSON**:
   - Set current phase status to "complete"
   - Increment `current_phase` value
   - Set next phase status to "in_progress" (if continuing)

3. **Verify clean state**:
   - `git status` should show clean working tree
   - Run relevant tests to confirm nothing broken

4. **Update todos**: Mark phase todos as completed, create new todos for next phase

## Pattern Research Guidelines

When implementing, use pattern-finder agent extensively to match existing code style:

**Pattern Research is Contextual** - Match your research to what you're building:

- **Working on a Component?** → Find similar components in `src/components/`, examine their props, state, and rendering patterns
- **Working on a Hook?** → Find other hooks in `src/utils/`, see how they manage state and return values
- **Working on a Utility?** → Look at other utilities in `src/utils/`, match function signatures and patterns
- **Working on Tests?** → Look at `test/` for existing test patterns, mock setup, and act() usage

**Key Principles:**

1. Search for patterns in the SAME DIRECTORY first - local conventions trump general patterns
2. Look for the SAME TYPE of component - Components reference Components, Hooks reference Hooks
3. When in doubt, find 2-3 examples and follow the most common pattern
